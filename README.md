# CCMSI-Portfolio
## Description

For this assignment, my objective was to create a website from scratch which would showcase my talents and portfolio to employers. For this particular website, I am targeting my current employer, CCMSI. I had to create a HTML, a CSS reset style sheet, and a CSS style sheet

## Motivation

When I started with my current employer, CCMSI, I was most motivated when I was helping people with technology. Although I was hired with the intentions of becoming an insurance adjuster, I was most intrigued by IT and working with technology. This is what inspired me to create this page. On the logo part of the nav bar, it says "CCMSI Portfolio". This website is targeted for the hiring manager of my current employer over the web development department.

As you can see, the pictures have flex applied to them so that when you resize it for a mobile screen, each picture is flexed into a new row.
