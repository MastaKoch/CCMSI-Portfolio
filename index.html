                            <p>After completing the CCMSI-U internship program upon graduation from Clemson University,
                                I was ready to navigate the world of Workers' Comp and Insurance Claims. I immersed myself in claims,
                                all while helping set up our start-up office in the Queen City. I set up computers, phone lines, 
                                internet servers, desks and seating arrangements all while training to become an adjuster.
                            </p>
                        <br>
                          
                        <p> 
                            During my time as an adjuster-in-training, I became the non-official IT "go-to" guy. 
                            With the help of the IT team, I learned the ropes when it came to helping the office 
                            with their technology challenges, all while preparing for the world of insurance. I 
                            took great pride in assisting the office with technology despite working as an adjuster.
                            After about 10 months of limited training due to COVID-19, I had to quickly adapt to a 
                            new working reality. However, in early October 2020 I stumbled across an advertisement 
                            for a virtual Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp through the University of North Carolina 
                            at Charlotte. I decided to use COVID as an opportunity to really grow and push myself outside 
                            of my comfort zone in my professional life/career. A couple of phone calls and emails later and 
                            I was starting class the following week.
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Now, after a year of learning the world of the insurance and claims language, 
                            I picked up a new language: programming. I am currently training and working 
                            as a Service Developer for CCMSI, and I will graduate from Boot Camp in April 2021.
                            Nobody said that the path was going to be easy, and that's why I fell in love with the challenge.
