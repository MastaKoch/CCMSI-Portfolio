                        <p>Welcome to my page. Before we dive into my portfolio, I would like to introduce myself. 
                            I am Alex Koch and I am blessed to have the opportunity to showcase my talents to whoever is reading this. 
                            I am a full stack web developer. How did I get here? Let’s rewind to the workers’ comp insurance adjuster part of my story. 
                            Upon accepting an internship with CCMSI, a TPA who handles the state of NC’s tax dollars for workers’ compensation claims, 
                            I was immersed into the world of insurance. During that internship, I fell in love with the company. I found a place that 
                            truly wanted to invest in me; in turn, I wanted to invest into CCMSI. When I was in the internship, we were working out of 
                            a small office space (we were a start-up in Charlotte, NC). In this office space, we did not have a local IT department. 
                            Many of my fellow coworkers were not as technologically savvy as I was. I assisted with everything IT related either on my own 
                            or on the phone with the IT team collaborating to find a solution to the problem at hand. I manually configured and set up all 
                            of the computers in the office and knew the layout of everything technology related in the office. I quickly came to realize that 
                            a part of me had really come alive, and that was my passion for technology and big tech. And although I pursued Elementary education 
                            in college for my undergraduate degree, I quickly came to realize that my career path should align with my passion, which is solving 
                            problems. I am a problem solver at heart and that is why I am a full stack web developer. I hope you enjoyed my page and thank you for 
                            your consideration.
